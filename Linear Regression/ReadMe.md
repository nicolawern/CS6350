HW2 - Linear Regression To run the Linear Regression code please download all files in the folder and run run.sh with option 1=True to run batch gradient descent and 2=True to run stochastic gradient descent. Eg: sh run.sh True True Set to False for either to not run them. They will each output a plot of the cost fn, the learning rate that lead to convergence, the final weight vector, and the calculated test error based on weights at train convergence. If you want to replace the train/test for please make sure they are named the same as the train/test files in the repository.
