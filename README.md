# CS6350

This is a machine learning library developed by Nicola Wernecke for
CS5350/6350 in University of Utah".

HW1
To run the Decision Tree code please download all files and run run.sh. If you want to replace the train/test for either cars or bank please make sure they are named the same as the train/test files in the repository.
The output is an array of the incorrect labels/total labels from tree depth 1-6 for cars and 1-17 for bank. The average error is also printed for both test and train and all calculations. 

HW2
To run the Ensemble Learning code please download all files in the folder and run run.sh. If you want to replace the train/test please make sure they are named the same as the train/test files in the repository.

To run the Linear Regression code please download all files in the folder and run run.sh with option 1=True to run batch gradient descent and 2=True to run stochastic gradient descent. Set to false for either to not run them. They will each output a plot of the cost fn, the learning rate that lead to convergence, the final weight vector, and the calculated test error based on weights at train convergence. If you want to replace the train/test for please make sure they are named the same as the train/test files in the repository.
